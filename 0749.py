Project 749: Trust Calibration in AI Systems
Description:
Trust calibration refers to the process of aligning the confidence (predicted probability) of a machine learning model with its actual performance. A well-calibrated model’s predicted probabilities should closely match the true likelihood of an event. For example, if a model predicts a probability of 0.8 for an event, that event should occur approximately 80% of the time. This project will focus on evaluating and improving the calibration of a machine learning model. Specifically, we will use calibration techniques like Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression to calibrate a Random Forest classifier and evaluate the calibration performance using Brier score.

Python Implementation (Trust Calibration with Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression)
We will train a Random Forest classifier on the Iris dataset, calibrate the model using Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression, and evaluate its calibration performance using the Brier score.

Explanation:
Dataset Loading and Preprocessing: We load the Iris dataset and preprocess it by encoding the target labels (species) into integers using LabelEncoder.

Model Training: A Random Forest classifier is trained on the dataset using 100 trees in the forest.

Model Calibration:

We calibrate the trained model using Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression, both of which are common calibration methods:

Platt Scaling uses a logistic regression model to map predicted probabilities to calibrated values.

Isotonic Regression applies a non-linear function to map predicted probabilities to calibrated values.

Brier score loss is used to evaluate how well the calibrated models predict probabilities. A lower Brier score indicates better calibration.

Calibration Curve Visualization: We use calibration_curve to plot the calibration curve, which shows how well the predicted probabilities align with the actual outcomes. A well-calibrated model should have a curve that closely matches the diagonal line (perfect calibration).

Model Evaluation: We print the Brier score loss for both Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression models and visualize their calibration curves to assess the quality of calibration.

By using these calibration methods, we improve the model’s trustworthiness and ensure that its predicted probabilities are reliable. This is crucial when the model’s predictions are used in decision-making processes.
